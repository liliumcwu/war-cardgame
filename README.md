#### An Application for Playing War, the Card Game

## Technology Used

#### Front End:
HTML | CSS | Javascript

## Getting Started

Click "Start Game." You can restart anytime.

Every time you draw a card by pressing "Fight!", the computer will compare the drawn cards.

If one card has higher value per the rules of War, the drawn cards will go to the corresponding player.

If the cards have the same value, pressing "Fight!" will draw two cards for each player. Only the second cards will be shown and compared. The aggregated cards in such a war round will go to the winner once two cards of different value are compared.

## Approach

This was my first web application built in 1 day after learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I approached this project with a narrow scope as a learning process for these languages.

## Next Steps

### Unsolved Issues

The UI could be improved. For instance, I did not code a way for visualizing the arrays of cards drawn in war rounds.

Due to the randomized nature of War, the game can go on infinitely and is thus not super exciting to play.
